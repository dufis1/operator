# Operator — Roadmap

*Last updated: April 8, 2026 (session 65)*

> **Current status: Phase 9 hardening in progress (session 65).** Steps 9.1 (selector hardening), 9.4 (race condition audit), and 9.5 (security audit) complete. Steps 9.2/9.3 deferred to Phase 12. Next: 9.6 (simultaneous meeting handling).

## Completed Phases

<details>
<summary>Phases 1–6 + Caption Refactor + MCP Integration (all ✅)</summary>

### Phase 1: Extract the Agent Pipeline ✅
Pulled all "brain" logic out of `app.py` into `pipeline/` with zero macOS-specific code.

### Phase 2: Define the Connector Interface ✅
Defined `MeetingConnector` abstract interface. Wrapped macOS logic as `MacOSAdapter`.

### Phase 3: Docker/Cloud Adapter ✅
Built headless Linux adapter in Docker. Verified end-to-end in live Google Meet.

### Phase 4: Reorient — Cloud Cleanup + Linux Local Adapter ✅
Moved cloud artifacts into `cloud/`. Adapted Docker adapter into `LinuxAdapter` for local Linux machines.

### Phase 5: Config System ✅
All hardcoded constants moved into `config.yaml` with `config.py` reader.

### Phase 6: Consolidate Entry Points ✅
Shared loop extracted into `pipeline/runner.py`. OS auto-detection via `python -m operator`. Calendar poller replaced `calendar_join.py`.

### Caption Refactor ✅
Replaced ScreenCaptureKit + Whisper with Google Meet DOM caption scraping. Eliminates echo problem, privacy issues, and Whisper dependency on macOS.

### Phase 11 (original): MCP Integration ✅
MCP client connects to configured servers at startup, discovers tools. Tool-call loop in LLMClient handles tool_call → execute → result → re-prompt. Chat-specific LLM settings. Config schema for `mcp_servers`. Validated with Linear and GitHub MCP servers end-to-end in live Meet.

### Phase 7: Performance Iteration ✅ (partial)
Audio quality, TTS 3-tier architecture, latency masking, STT accuracy (mlx-whisper), streaming classification, playback interrupt classification, latency docs. Deferred to voice phase: TTS error handling/retry, premature finalization at 0.7s silence threshold.

## Phase 8: Chat-First MVP (THE CURRENT FOCUS)

*The pivot. Ship a chat-based task delegation bot as v1. Voice layers on top later.*

**Why:** A real user (engineer at a remote company) wants to delegate tasks to the bot via Google Chat during meetings. Chat I/O is simpler than voice — no wake detection, no latency tuning, no TTS. Ship something, get feedback, expand from there.

**Scope:** Google Meet only. Mac + Linux (Playwright is cross-platform, so Linux support is essentially free for chat-based interaction). Zoom/Teams deferred until there's confirmed user demand — each platform requires its own DOM selectors, join flow, and auth story.

**Core reframe:** Voice and chat are interaction layers over a shared capability layer. The audio pipeline stays in the codebase untouched.

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 8.0 | Clean the house — reorganize root, consolidate docs | ✅ |
| 8.1 | Chat I/O proof of concept — bot reads and writes Google Chat messages during a live meeting (echo test, no LLM). Create `ChatRunner` alongside `AgentRunner` — same `LLMClient`, simpler I/O loop. No codebase reorg needed; existing connector/pipeline separation already fits. | ✅ echo test passing e2e |
| 8.2 | Wire up the brain — connect chat input to LLM, respond in chat | ✅ |
| 8.2.1 | Chat hardening — history cap (configurable), wake phrase gating for multi-participant, sender field extraction from DOM | ✅ |
| 8.2.2 | Meeting lifecycle — pre-join user gate, end-time auto-leave, stale meeting skip, Ctrl+C clean shutdown | ✅ |
| 8.3 | Ship to friend — minimal setup, clear instructions, get it in his hands | ✅ | ~2h |

## Phase 9: Hardening & Reliability

*Make what we have bulletproof before shipping to strangers.*

| 9.13 | Context window management — strategy for summarizing/truncating older chat history as conversation grows, prevent silent context overflow | ⬜ | ~3h |
| 9.14 | Idempotency guards — prevent duplicate tool actions from repeated requests ("create a ticket" said twice), confirmation before write operations | ⬜ Post-v1 | ~3h |
| 9.15 | Offline/reconnection behavior — handle internet drops, Playwright page loss, browser crashes; decide: crash, wait, or rejoin | ⬜ | ~4h |
| 9.16 | Edge case pass — systematic audit of boundary conditions: empty meetings, rapid join/leave, malformed chat input, Unicode/emoji in messages, MCP server returning unexpected data, concurrent tool calls, browser memory leaks in long meetings | ⬜ | ~4h |

---

## Phase 12: MCP Hardening & Extensibility

*Make MCP integration robust, configurable, and open to user-defined servers.*

| Step | Description | Status | Est. |
|------|-------------|--------|------|
| 12.1 | Per-MCP `hints` field in config — server-specific LLM guidance injected into system prompt | ⬜ | ~1h |
| 12.2 | Setup wizard auto-populates hints — resolve identity (GitHub `get_me`, etc.) during onboarding, store in config | ⬜ | ~2h |

| 12.12 | MCP server health check — weekly CI job that starts each configured MCP server and calls `list_tools()`; alert on failure. Extend step 10.8 smoke test with a dry-run tool call per server | ⬜ | ~2h |
| 12.13 | MCP tool call failure monitoring — track per-server `MCPToolError` rate at runtime; log warning when failure rate spikes above threshold; surface in diagnostics | ⬜ | ~2h |

---

## Phase 13: Voice Interaction

*Layer voice as a second interaction modality on top of the proven chat capability layer.*

---

## Phase 14: Meeting Platform Expansion (demand-driven)

*Add support for Zoom and/or Microsoft Teams. Only pursue when a real user needs it.*

Each platform requires: DOM chat selectors, join flow, auth handling, and ongoing selector maintenance as UIs change. Architect Phase 8 with a thin chat read/write abstraction so new platforms are additive (new implementation, not a rewrite).

**Alternative path:** If Recall.ai is adopted as optional infrastructure (see Open Questions), this phase reduces to building a single `RecallConnector` that wraps their API — instant multi-platform support without per-platform DOM work.

| Step | Description | Status | Est. |
|------|-------------|--------|------|
| 14.1 | Define `ChatConnector` interface (read messages, send messages, platform identity) | ⬜ | ~2h |
| 14.2 | Zoom — spike on chat DOM, implement connector | ⬜ | ~8h |
| 14.3 | Microsoft Teams — spike on chat DOM, implement connector | ⬜ | ~8h |

## Key Decisions

- **Architecture:** Three-layer separation (pipeline / connector / platform shell)
- **Primary platform:** Local machine (macOS + Linux). Cloud is upgrade path.
- **Input (macOS Meet):** DOM caption scraping. Audio pipeline preserved behind `connector.type: audio`.
- **STT (audio fallback):** mlx-whisper base on macOS; faster-whisper base on Linux.
- **LLM:** GPT-4.1-mini
- **TTS:** Three-tier — local (Kokoro) / openai / elevenlabs. Default: Kokoro af_heart.
- **Meeting detection:** Browser-based Google Calendar scraping (30s interval).
- **Licensing:** MIT
- **Python target:** 3.11
- **Pivot (April 2026):** Chat-first v1, voice layered on later. Motivated by real user demand for task delegation via meeting chat.
- **MVP scope (April 2026):** Google Meet only, Mac + Linux. Platform cost is in meeting service (DOM selectors, auth), not OS — Playwright is cross-platform. Zoom/Teams deferred to Phase 14, demand-driven.
- **V1 positioning (April 2026):** "Meetings that produce artifacts, not just words." Tool use during meetings is the moat — no competitor does this. Pika wins on presentation (avatar/voice), Recall wins on infrastructure (multi-platform), Operator wins on capability (MCP tool use, live context, extensibility).

### Open Questions

- **Recall.ai as optional connector?** Recall offers managed meeting bot infrastructure ($0.50/hr) covering Zoom, Meet, Teams, Webex via a single API. Could add `connector: recall` in config.yaml as an alternative to self-hosted connectors — eliminates browser automation, audio routing, and platform maintenance. Tradeoff: proprietary dependency vs. drastically reduced plumbing burden. Hybrid model (self-hosted default, Recall optional) preserves open source spirit. Relevant to Phase 14 — could skip building Zoom/Teams connectors entirely.
- **Local LLM support?** Swap GPT-4.1-mini for Ollama/llama.cpp to enable a fully zero-API-key deployment. Combined with existing local Whisper + Kokoro TTS, this would make Operator runnable with no paid services at all — a genuine differentiator. Tradeoff: local models are weaker at agentic tool use (MCP) and response quality. Could offer as a config tier: `llm: local | openai`.

## Not On This Plan

- DigitalOcean droplet deployment (preserved in `cloud/`)
- Loadout sharing / registry
- Windows support
- Multi-agent concurrency
