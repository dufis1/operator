"""
Caption late-bind behavior — set_caption_callback works before OR after join().

Validates the late-bind design: the JS bridge is exposed at browser startup
whenever CAPTIONS_ENABLED is true, so a callback registered after the browser
is already running still receives captions cleanly. Useful when the meeting
slug is only known post-navigation (e.g. opening `meet.new`), so the
finalizer cannot be registered up front. Tests exercise the Python-side
bridge stub directly (no Playwright launch) because that's the only piece
the late-bind fix changes — the JS observer hasn't moved.
