"""
Claude Code CLI LLM provider.

Wraps a long-lived `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format
stream-json` subprocess as an LLMProvider. One subprocess per meeting:
spawned lazily on the first complete() call, fed each turn's new user
message over stdin, terminated via stop() at meeting end.

Architecturally different from the OpenAI / Anthropic providers:
inner-claude owns its own tool-use loop, system prompt stack, and
context. We do not pass `tools`, `model`, or `max_tokens` — claude
handles those internally. `system` is consumed once at spawn time as
--append-system-prompt and ignored on subsequent calls (the system
prompt is set for the lifetime of the subprocess).

The subprocess runs under the user's Claude Max subscription
(apiKeySource: "none"); we explicitly clear ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the
spawn env and assert apiKeySource at startup so an env-leak can never
silently bill the user's API account.
