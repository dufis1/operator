"""
PreToolUse hook bridge — invoked by claude on every tool_use.

Lifecycle: claude spawns one bridge process per PreToolUse event. The
bridge gets the tool_use payload on stdin, writes it to the request
named-pipe (where the brainchild parent's pump thread is listening),
blocks reading the response pipe, and then prints the decision JSON to
stdout in the shape claude expects.

CLI:
    python -m brainchild.pipeline.permission_bridge <req_pipe> <resp_pipe>

stdin: Claude Code's PreToolUse JSON, e.g.
    {"tool_name": "Write", "tool_input": {"file_path": "...", "content": "..."},
     "tool_use_id": "...", ...}

stdout (on exit 0): the hookSpecificOutput envelope claude expects:
    {"hookSpecificOutput": {
        "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
        "permissionDecision": "allow" | "deny" | "ask",
        "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}

The parent (brainchild) sends back the inner decision dict (without
`hookSpecificOutput` wrapping) so its handler stays focused on the
permission semantics; the bridge handles the envelope shape.

Failure modes:
  - Pipes missing: print deny, exit 0 (claude still sees a clean decision).
  - Parent never responds within HARD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: deny with timeout reason.
  - JSON parse errors on the wire: deny with parse reason.

Hard-fail (exit 2) is reserved for cases where we want claude to see the
error directly; here we always emit a clean JSON allow/deny so claude's
control flow stays predictable.
