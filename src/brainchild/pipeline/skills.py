"""
Skill loader — reads Claude Code-style SKILL.md folders for Brainchild.

Skill library model (Phase 15.11, session 152):
  - Shared library at ~/.brainchild/skills/<name>/SKILL.md (one per user,
    shared across all agents). Seeded on first run from the bundled package.
  - Optional per-agent `external_paths` list declared in config.yaml
    (skills.external_paths). Entries must be tilde-prefixed (`~/…`) or
    absolute (`/…`); relative paths are CWD-dependent and WARN + skipped.
  - Agent config names the skills it uses via `skills.enabled: [names]`.

Resolution order (last-wins for name collisions):
  1. Shared library.
  2. Each external_paths entry, in list order.

So an agent can override a library skill by pointing at an external path
containing a same-named SKILL.md — the external one wins. Useful for
testing a local skill variant without touching the library copy.

SKILL.md frontmatter:
  - `name` — required. Unique identifier shown in the wizard + LLM prompts.
  - `description` — required. Trigger-phrase-first one-liner the LLM
    matches against. Lead with the phrases that should fire the skill.
  - `allowed-tools` — optional list/csv. Non-MCP tool hints; anything
    outside SUPPORTED_ALLOWED_TOOLS logs a WARN but still loads.
  - `mcp-required` (alias `mcp_required`) — optional list/csv of MCP
    server names this skill fundamentally relies on. Consumed by the
    setup wizard to lock matching MCP toggles on. Missing = no declared
    deps (honest default). User-authored skills that omit this field
    load unconditionally; the runtime safety net in
    mcp_client.disabled_server_for_tool raises an actionable
    "server disabled" error if the LLM actually tries to call a tool
    from a disabled server.

The remainder of the file is the skill body — free-form instructions fed
to the LLM when the skill is invoked.

A skill location can be either shape:
  - A folder containing SKILL.md  → single skill.
  - A parent folder               → scanned one level deep for */SKILL.md.

Malformed or missing entries WARN and are skipped rather than crashing.
