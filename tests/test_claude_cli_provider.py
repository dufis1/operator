"""
Smoke test for ClaudeCLIProvider.

Unlike the other provider tests this one is not mocked — it actually
spawns the `claude -p` CLI under the user's Claude Max subscription and
runs a 3-turn arithmetic conversation through it. The point is to
confirm the per-meeting subprocess actually works end-to-end:
  - lazy spawn
  - subscription-auth assertion (apiKeySource: "none")
  - stream-json envelope shape on stdin
  - result-event latching on stdout
  - context retention across turns within the same subprocess
  - clean teardown via stop()

Skipped if `claude` is not on PATH or if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in the
environment (which would force API-key auth and trip our subscription
assertion). The test removes ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the spawn env itself,
but if the developer running the test has it locally they should know
the test is intentionally exercising the no-API-key path.

Run:
    source venv/bin/activate
    python tests/test_claude_cli_provider.py
